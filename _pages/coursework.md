## Fall 2024
- **Math 375** 
- **Physics 247**
- **Comp Sci 200**
- **LSC 100**

 **Math 375** - Topics in Multi-Variable Calculus and Linear Algebra (Honors)    
 This is the first proof based class I have taken. This is a part of the 375/376 sequence so about 2/3 of the class is linear algebra
 and the other 1/3 is multi-variable calculus. The beginning of this class was extremely difficult due to my lack of knowledge of proofs, but it did get easier later on. Professor Uyanik was able to explain concepts in class very well and was very willing to answer question or clarify concepts. This was by far my hardest class this semester.

 **Physics 247** - A Modern Introduction to Physics (Honors)  
Not a fun class. The class was very fast paced. We went over mechanics in just 3-4 weeks (almost all of AP Physics C), and then went onto special relativity and gravity. Professor Balantekin is a very smart and respectable man, but his teaching style is not the best for introductory classes as his homework is extremely difficult and during his lectures, he tends to go off topic. Midway through the semester, Professor Pan taught the class and the lectures were much better and the homework was not as difficult. After taking this class I have come to the realization that I do not like physics.

 **Computer Science 200**  - Programming I  
An introduction to programming using Java. Relatively simple and straight forward course. This courses uses zybooks for the weekly reading, activities, and labs. There are also weekly assignments that are on canvas. Since I had prior coding experience this course was not too bad. However, if you have no coding experience it might be a little difficult.

Hi, I am a freshman at The Univerisity of Wisconsin - Madison. I have a broad interest in Computer Science, Math, and Economics. I would like to combine all 3 fields to make a useful contribution to the world. Currently I am mostly interested in how we can use reinforcement learning and game theory to help model economic policy by simulating human interactions.
